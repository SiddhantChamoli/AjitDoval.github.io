            in the release of passengers from the hijacked IC-814 in Kandahar in 1999. He successfully terminated at least 15 hijackings of Indian Airlines aircraft between 1971 and 1999. Doval is said
            to have spent seven years as an undercover operative in Pakistan gathering intelligence on active militant groups. After a one-year stint as a secret agent, he worked at the Indian High
